    <dt>Replicants</dt>
        <dd>Agents in pdyn 1.5 created with assigned personal properties (according to respective heuristics) at the time of creating their households; Replicants are agents outside of the basic GUS model. 
        The replicants have at least one of two important aspect:
            (1) special properties which require additional, very specific parameters (like a maximum distance between a dorm house and a university); or (2) their properties are strongly correlated in a custom way (e.g. all members of dorm households are students of the same university; all prisoners in the same cell have the same gender, don't work and don't attend any educational institution).   
        To put it in another way: replicants are extreme exceptions to the statistics which rule the core of our society. They influence the structure in a way which would never emerge on its own. Those properties preclude replicants from being created in our usual, organic process. We need another pass with separate procedures.</dd>

        <dd>Type of replicants.</dd>

        <dd>Counter of all replicants.</dd>
    <dt>ReplicantsPopulation</dt>
        <dd>Agents pool from which replicants are created. To help keep the population statistics correct, all replicants are created from one common pool  of "people" - which itself is based on Wroc≈Çaw's population from our GUS data (for no special reason).</dd>
